# AAiT-Space
A go-to place for AAiT studens that embeds files from short notes to lecture materials for all departments.

## Welcome All Learners of [AAiT](https://aait.edu.et)
### What is **AAiT Space?**

This is a place for students particularly of Addis Ababa Institute of Technology to find lecture notes, course materials and everything that we wish we had access to
when we were noobies, we were all savvies at some point right? So, here we try to avoid the clumsiness, okay!

This was a project suggested by our mentor, Eyob, when we were interns in Minstery of Innovation and Technology. We have tried as much as we could to collect
each and every course material on every subject of every department in AAiT. Everything from hand written notes from mates to exclusive lecture videos links will
be shared here.
